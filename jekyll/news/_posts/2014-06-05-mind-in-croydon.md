We are delighted to be working with Mind in Croydon to raise funds for people and their families living with mental health issues in our local area.

We will be holding our Stand Up to Stigma event before the end of the year, a night of comedy in aid of this fantastic charity. More details to follow soon.

On 26 October Kevin, Phil, Sophie and Barbara from the SARD team will be taking part in the Great South Run, with all sponsorship raised also being donated to Mind in Croydon. The team can be sponsored online at www.justgiving.com/runningsard.

Mind in Croydon is a very active charity that works with people with mental health problems and their families in Croydon. It aims to increase understanding of the difficulties faced by those with mental health problems. Its various projects help to relieve social isolation, enable people to acquire skills for independent life and promote positive mental health.

More information can be be found on their website www.mindincroydon.org.uk.

Registered Charity number 1073880.
